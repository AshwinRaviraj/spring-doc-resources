# Spring Doc Resources

This project holds the static resources that Spring uses for document production. That includes the following:

* `stylesheets/spring.css`: The stylesheet for the HTML versions of the Spring reference guides.
* `javascript/tocbot`: The javascript library that creates the dynamic table of contents for the HTML versions of the Spring reference guides.
* `html/docinfo.html` and `html/docinfo-footer.html`: The static HTML files that tocbot needs.
